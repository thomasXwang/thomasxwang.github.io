 abstract = {We introduce AutoBasisEncoder, a novel framework designed for operator learn- ing – the task of learning to map from one function to another. This approach au- tonomously discovers a basis of functions optimized for the target function space and utilizes this pre-trained basis for efficient operator learning. By introducing an intermediary auto-encoding task to the popular DeepONet framework, AutoBa- sisEncoder disentangles the learning of the basis functions and of the coefficients, simplifying the operator learning process. Initially, the framework learns basis functions through auto-encoding, followed by leveraging this basis to predict the coefficients of the target function. Preliminary experiments indicate that Auto- BasisEncoder’s basis functions exhibit superior suitability for operator learning and function reconstruction compared to DeepONet. These findings underscore the potential of AutoBasisEncoder to enhance the landscape of operator learning frameworks},
