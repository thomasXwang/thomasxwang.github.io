abstract: We present AROMA (Attentive Reduced Order Model with Attention), a framework
  designed to enhance the modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) using
  local neural fields. Our flexible encoder-decoder architecture can obtain smooth
  latent representations of spatial physical fields from a variety of data types,
  including irregular-grid inputs and point clouds. This versatility eliminates the
  need for patching and allows efficient processing of diverse geometries. The sequential
  nature of our latent representation can be interpreted spatially and permits the
  use of a conditional transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics of PDEs. By
  employing a diffusion-based formulation, we achieve greater stability and enable
  longer rollouts compared to conventional MSE training. AROMA's superior performance
  in simulating 1D and 2D equations underscores the efficacy of our approach in capturing
  complex dynamical behaviors.
