abstract: Operator learning methods are too often constrained by a fixed sampling
  of both the input and output functions. We propose a novel method to allow current
  operator learning methods to learn on any sampling. We show that our method can
  perform inference on unseen samplings, and that it allows returning outputs as continuous
  functions.
